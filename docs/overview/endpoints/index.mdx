# Endpoints

This section serves the purpose of different endpoints for different projects on top of Osmosis.

## Mainnet Chain Endpoints

- gRPC endpoint: [grpc.osmosis.zone:9090](grpc.osmosis.zone:9090)
- gRPC-gateway: [https://rpc.osmosis.zone:443](https://rpc.osmosis.zone:443)
- lcd-endpoint: [https://lcd.osmosis.zone](https://lcd.osmosis.zone)

Swagger for RPC and LCD: 
- rpc swagger: [https://rpc-docs.osmosis.zone/](https://rpc-docs.osmosis.zone/)
